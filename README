Genetic algorithm for approximating bitmap images with bunch of triangles
=========================================================================

This program takes in a 512x512 bitmap image with RGB colours and tries to 
create an approximation for it using 50 triangles with different colours and
opacities.

The method for doing this is a genetic algorithm: the program holds at all
times a number of triangle approximations for the original image and tries to
modify and combine those approximations to get better ones. Bad approximations
get discarded, better ones survive.

At least with the current version, finding any sensible approximation for an
image will take a long time. Several hours at least, maybe days.
